I'm currently studying the Frontend Developer Career Path course on [Scrimba](http:\\scrimba.com)

I have a few decades of software-related experience including agile project management, technical documentation writing, installer creation, SQL basics, PMG automation platform, C# basics, and other software lifecycle management concepts and methods over the years. But at the moment I've decided to really dig in and focus on getting a proper solid foundation in the skills and langauges for front end development as a way of expanding my areas of knowledge in my day job as an automation specialist at The Home Depot IT department.
